# The Green New UNIX

We only have one planet, and we're choking it with CO2!
As programmers, we contribute to this:

- we love our deliveries from the other side of the world,
- we dig our streaming services which amount to digital deliveries that consume cloud and networking electricity, and
- we drone away all day long in our pajamas the heat jacked up.

What can we do!?
We need a Green New Deal...for UNIX!

**Lets grow trees.**

## `tree` Command

Quickly look at the [`tree` command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command)).
An example:

```
$ tree path/to/folder/
path/to/folder/
├── a-first.html
├── b-second.html
├── subfolder
│   ├── readme.html
│   ├── code.cpp
│   └── code.h
└── z-last-file.html

1 directories, 6 files
```

I know.
Maybe a little underwhelming.
But remember, every little tree grown helps!
Thus we're going to similarly grow some trees in our own garden!

## Go Forth, Green Warrior!

Check out `garden.c`.
Within it are four `TODO` items.
Go forth with your green thumbs and tend to your trees!
